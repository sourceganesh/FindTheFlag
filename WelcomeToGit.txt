Welcome to Git. 

Git, in simple words, is a tool that helps you put your code online, and allow different people to contribute to it.

Git is not restricted to simply that. Git is also essential in Version Control.

The scope of this CTF is to simply let you all know the very basics of git and crack our secret message in the process.

If you are reading this, know that, there has already been a "commit" made. Commits are checkpoints. They are the "save" feature of a game.

When you commit your project, the project will take a snapshot of everything you have and store it. Breaking it down to the simplest core way, git is a collection of a lots of commits. 

Here I will be adding your first part of the flag (1/4) "acm{c0mM1t". This flag will only be visible in this commit. It will be removed in the future versions.
